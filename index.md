# Nate Givens
## Spec Fic Writer & Machine Learning Engineer

I'm a speculative fiction writer, entrepreneur, and machine learning engineer. My [stories](stories) have appeared in anthologies and magazines and I've been a Finalist in the Writers of the Future Contest. Back in the day, I co-founded SRRN Games, a mobile video game studio that made some pretty awesome games. Currently, I build AI/ML systems to help data centers optimize power usage. I live in my hometown of Richmond, VA.
