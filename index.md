I'm a speculative fiction writer, entrepreneur, and machine learning engineer. My [stories](stories) have appeared in anthologies and magazines and I've been a Finalist in the Writers of the Future Contest. Back in the day, I co-founded SRRN Games, a mobile video game studio that made some pretty awesome games. Currently, I build AI/ML systems to help data centers optimize power usage. I live in my hometown of Richmond, VA and I'm also on [Twitter](https://x.com/writenatewrite), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanielgivens/), and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/nategivenswriter).
