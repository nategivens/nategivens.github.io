When I was in high school I figured a couple of things out. First, I wanted to be a science fiction writer. Second, since writing science fiction is a tough way to earn a living, I better acquire a marketable skill. Computers seemed cool, so I signed up to work in my high school's computer lab and started learning. I haven't stopped since.

Academically, I have a BS in mathematics, an ME in systems engineering, and an MA in economics. Professionally, I've worked for startups (including as a co-founder), big banks and insurance companies, and everything in between. I've spent most of my time doing data analystics, data science, software, and finally machine learning engineering (which is by far the most fun).

After focusing on building a solid professional foundation, I returned to writing seriously in 2017. Even though times have changed a lot since I sketched out the career I hoped to have 30 years ago, I've never given up a nostalgic love of short fiction, where speculative fiction really shines. I sold my first short story in 2020 then seven more through 2024. I continue to write and submit short stories while I work on my novels as well. I write hard sci-fi, space opera, military sci-fi, and also urban fantasy and steampunk. 

I grew up in the Richmond, Virginia area where I still live with my wife and kids and our pets.
