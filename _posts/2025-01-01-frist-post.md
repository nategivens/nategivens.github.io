A long time ago in a social milieu far away, randos would race each other to post the first response to each new Slashdot article. Maybe they still do that. I don't know. That's a site I haven't visited in a long time. In any case, they would also often intentionally misspell "first post". As I'm getting this new site setup and a placeholder blog post will help: I'm honoring that legacy. So, yes: frist post!
